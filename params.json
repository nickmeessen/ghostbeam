This has been specifically designed to be invisible since some people like their homescreens clutter-free.\r\n\r\nUsage / Play Store \r\n=========\r\nTo install, just add the widget to one of your homescreens. It will display the Ghost icon so you can move the widget to it's desired location with long-press. After the first click/touch on it, it will go invisible.\r\n\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.nickmeessen.ghostbeam\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer \r\n=========\r\nIt's only been tested on a few selected devices, every device has it's own implementation of the LED Flashlight, so it might work for most people but some might experience the LED shutting off when turning off the screen or not being able to use it at all. The widget is provided as is, I made it for personal use but deciced to release it for other people. If it doesn't work I'm sorry but I've done my best to support multiple devices and I quit development on this a long while ago.\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork and improve ;-)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
